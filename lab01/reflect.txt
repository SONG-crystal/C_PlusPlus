1. what is the effect of the keyword "constexpr"
constexpr is a powerful tool that can be used to improve performance.
it evaluated at compile-time not run-time

2. Why rule of three are necessary and in what situation a class must implement them. 
When data has resources, which mean pointer pointing address at heap memory, rule of 3 must implemented it
There are posibility to copy or assign with resources. Without rule of three, shallow copy will cause errors.
This is because pointer always pointing to the address of something even it has copied.
That is the reason why we have to deal with(delete and re-assign it) our memory when data has resources.

-extern keyword used in header file (now, all modules can use this!)
-would define and initialize it in cpp file
 //header                         //cpp
 extern double g_taxrate;         double g_taxrate = 0.0;
 extern double g_discount;        double g_discount = 0.0;

-C style null terminated string of up to 10 characters including null byte terminator means "char vaiableName[10]"

-for safe state for all data members, can use keywords curly braces {}

-include libray must need when using..
 #include <iomanip> //for setw
 #include <cstring> //for string
 #include <string>  //for getline

-style
  cout << left << setw(4) << ... << endl;
  cout << fixed;
  cout << setprecision(2) << ... << endl; //"fixed" and "setprecision" are get together when you want to set precision
         
-C++17
project right click - properties - C++ Language Standard - 17!

-When the program is started with the command,
project right click - properties - Debugging - Command Arguments - type it

-query
display(), bool(), getStatus() functions are queries, put const keyword is always good practice

-virtual
virtual destructor is always good for preventing memory leaks
